<p align="justify">I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/psychology/">Department of Psychology</a> at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a>. I am part of <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/language-lab/our-team/debra-titone-phd-lab-director">Dr. Debra Titone</a>'s <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/language-lab/">McGill Language & Multilingualism Lab</a> and <a href="https://btjohns.com/people">Dr. Brendan Johns</a>' <a href="https://btjohns.com/">McGill Cognitive Computing Lab</a>. I received my Ph.D. in Linguistics at the <a href="https://www.sns.it/en">Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa</a> in 2019, under the joint supervision of <a href="https://people.unipi.it/alessandro_lenci/">Prof. Alessandro Lenci</a> and <a href="https://www.sns.it/en/persona/pier-marco-bertinetto">Prof. Pier Marco Bertinetto</a>. </p>

<p align="justify">In my research, I make use of <b>computational</b> and <b>psycholinguistic</b> methodologies to understand how our experience with the ambient linguistic environment influences the way we use and process language, a concept that lies at the heart of <b>usage-based language models</b>. In particular, I have published work on the representation and processing of <b>multiword and idiomatic language</b> in first-language and second-language speakers, using a wide range of approaches, like eye-tracking during silent reading, distributional semantic models, corpus-based models of lexical strength, lexical decision latencies and other corpus-based and behavioral techniques. </p>
