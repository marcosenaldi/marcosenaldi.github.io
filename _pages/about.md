I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Department of Psychology](https://www.mcgill.ca/psychology/) at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). I am part of [Dr. Debra Titone](https://www.mcgill.ca/language-lab/our-team/debra-titone-phd-lab-director)'s [McGill Language & Multilingualism Lab](https://www.mcgill.ca/language-lab/) and [Dr. Brendan Johns](https://btjohns.com/people)'s [McGill Cognitive Computing Lab](https://btjohns.com/). I received my Ph.D. in Linguistics at the [Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa](https://www.sns.it/en) in 2019, under the joint supervision of [Prof. Alessandro Lenci](https://people.unipi.it/alessandro_lenci/) and [Prof. Pier Marco Bertinetto](https://www.sns.it/en/persona/pier-marco-bertinetto).

In my research, I apply **computational** and **psycholinguistic** methodologies to understand how our experience with the ambient linguistic environment influences the way we use and process language, a concept that lies at the heart of **usage-based language models**. A core component of my work revolves around the representation and processing of **multiword and idiomatic language** in first-language and second-language speakers.
