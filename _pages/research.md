<p align="justify"> My research agenda involves the integration of computational and psycholinguistic approaches to shed light on how our exposure to the surrounding linguistic environment shapes our language behavior. Specifically, most part of my research has focused on the representation and processing of <b> multiword and idiomatic language</b>. The increasing availability of corpora over the past decades has made it clear that most of our linguistic production involves fixed and recurrent multiword units like idioms, whose meaning often goes beyond the sum of their parts (e.g. <i>break the ice</i>, <i>spill the beans</i>, etc.). In this regard, understanding how they are represented and processed can give us insights about the general structure of the mental lexicon. </p>

Previous evidence from our lab ([Libben & Titone 2008](https://doi.org/10.3758/MC.36.6.1103); [Titone et al. 2019]( https://doi.org/10.1037/cep0000175)) supports a <b>hybrid model of idiom processing</b>, where idioms are both directly retrieved from memory and compositionally analyzed over different time courses during processing.

In an eye-tracking study published on <i>Memory & Cognition</i> ([Senaldi, Wei, Gullifer & Titone, 2022](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13421-022-01334-x)), my colleagues and I found that English L1-French L2 bilinguals were slower at reading idioms containing a momentary language switched as compared to matched literal controls. These data provided additional support to the role of direct retrieval in L1 idiom recognition.

In a follow-up study appeared on *Languages* ([Senaldi & Titone, 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/languages7020091)), we observed that L2 readers adopt a more compositional strategy, with L2 idioms being easier to process if the meaning of single idiom components is better related to the figurative meaning of the phrase.
