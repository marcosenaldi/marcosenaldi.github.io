### Representation and processing of multiword and idiomatic language

<p align="justify"> My research agenda involves the integration of computational and psycholinguistic approaches to shed light on how our exposure to the surrounding linguistic environment shapes our language behavior. Specifically, most part of my research has focused on the representation and processing of <b> multiword and idiomatic language</b>. Traditional models suggested a words-and-rules functioning of human language, with idiomatic sequences considered peripheral phenomena. Over the past few decades, extensive corpus studies have made it clear that most of our linguistic production involves fixed and recurrent units like idioms, whose meaning often goes beyond the sum of their parts (e.g. <i>break the ice</i>, <i>spill the beans</i>, etc.). In this regard, understanding how they are represented and processed can give us insights about the general structure of the mental lexicon. </p>

Evidence collected in our lab supports a <b>hybrid model of idiom processing</b>, where idioms are both directly retrieved from memory and compositionally analyzed over different time courses during processing.
